## by Blessed Utomi Job-Aigbovbioise

## Summary of Findings

> In 2013, there was surprisingly a large amount of loan given in comparison to other years.
> Surge months include January, Febuary and towards the year end (Ocotober, November, and December).
> Higher loan amounts are given for 36 or 60 months terms, 36 months recording the highest amounts.
> To increase one's chances of accessing higher loan amounts, the Borrower should have a home property and should be employed with their Debt-to-income ratio less than 0.50 - it was observed that most loans had the ratio of 0.35 with a threshold around point 0.50.
> A good Prosper Risk Score increases the likelihood of successfully borrowing higher amounts.


## Key Insights for Presentation

> The point of focus for the presentation is on the influence of Stated Monthly Income, Monthly Loan Payment, term, Debt to Income ratio on Loan Amount. The variable of interest is the loan amount; plots are constructed to show the relationships/corelations of other variables on our variable of interest.

> Scatter plots were used to show the correlation between Loan Amount and Monthly Loan Payment. The plot showed that borrowers with higher loan amounts have greater monthly repayment plans.

> To better define and clarify the observations with the relationship between Loan Amount and Monthly Payment, multivariate scatter and point plots were constructed. These showed that Loan Term played a primary part in determining the Loan Amount disbursed. Homeowners possessing employment statuses are noticed to be more likely to gain access to more loans that those who do not satisfy these criteria.
